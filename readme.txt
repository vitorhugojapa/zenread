Hello!
Thank you for choosing it!

Zen Read is a theme about contributing with a clean content for the web and is inspired by good typography blogs such as InterfaceLovers.com, WordPress Platform and Medium.

A web about content and wisdom.

Using the best native OS fonts, in harmony with image and video, Zen Read delivers a better reading and writing experience to content writers and their audience.

I would like to share a Haiku about Zen Read with you:
“Press with ease a Word
A strong mind reads it focused
Knowledge as it is”

I hope that you enjoy using it as I ejoyed designing it.
